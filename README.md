# Santa's Journey to Tech

## Event: μLearn's Illuμmnate Challenge

### Challenge Overview

Santa Claus, known for his impeccable gift-giving skills, is trading in his sleigh for a keyboard. That's right, the jolly old man is now on a mission to master Software Engineering. Who knew that delivering presents to millions around the world wasn’t quite as challenging as building scalable web apps? This portfolio is part of the μLearn Illuμmnate Challenge, where we're helping Santa transition into the tech industry. And yes, he’s open to remote roles—his reindeer are ready for the next adventure!
